## Declarations

### Time and Features

I wasn't able to add the innovative feature due to time constraints. If I had more time, I'd add time charts when converting currency, so the user knows their history and is able to make predictions based on their value. I'd adorn the page, since I barely had any time to do css.

### AI
I used AI to help me with the omit function, since I had a little trouble setting it up. Also I used it to help me with the table css.

### Specifications
I used 11 specified mayor currrencies, that way it is still at least 10 when you compare the value of one of them to the rest.
